# COVID-19 Patient Intubation Prediction

This repository contains the code, report, and presentation for the project **COVID-19 Patient Intubation Prediction**, developed as part of the ENGR 518 course. The project aims to predict the likelihood of COVID-19 patients requiring intubation using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

COVID-19 can lead to severe respiratory complications, necessitating intubation in critical cases. Early prediction of this need can aid in timely medical interventions, optimizing resource allocation and improving patient outcomes. This project leverages clinical data to develop a predictive model for intubation in COVID-19 patients.

## Repository Contents

- **[ENGR_518_Project_final.ipynb](ENGR_518_Project_final.ipynb)**: Jupyter Notebook containing the project code and analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle: [COVID-19 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meirnizri/covid19-dataset).

- **Description**: The dataset contains clinical features and outcomes for COVID-19 patients, including whether they required intubation.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Missing values were handled, and categorical features were encoded. Feature selection was performed to retain only the most relevant predictors.

## Features

The project followed these key steps:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: 
    - Clinical data of COVID-19 patients was sourced and cleaned for model training.
  
2. **Feature Engineering**: 
    - Relevant features were extracted and engineered to improve model performance.
  
3. **Model Development**: 
    - Various machine learning models were explored and evaluated to predict intubation likelihood.
  
4. **Evaluation and Results**: 
    - The models were assessed based on accuracy, precision, recall, and other performance metrics.

## Results

The final model achieved promising results, indicating its potential to assist healthcare providers in predicting the need for patient intubation. More details can be found in the [Project Report](Project_Report_final.pdf).

## Requirements

To run the code in the Jupyter Notebook, you will need the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
